# DAY 49 of 100 Linkedin-Job-Appication-Automation


### Challenges
- Applying to jons
- Ignore complex, mutli-step and note requiring applications
- Exception Handling using selenium's NoSuchElementException

#### Notes
- I had alot of chalenges in this easy looking program, the link takes me to linkedin but the sign in pop up comes and the 'find_elements(By.LINK_TEXT)' doesn't recognise it and using other selectors i was facing similar isues so i decided to go through the link the searching for the jobs directly then applying as it was the possible solution for me
- Took me longer than usual but managed to scale through at the end
