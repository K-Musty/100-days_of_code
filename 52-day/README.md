# Day 52 of 100- Instagram Follower Bot
-------
### Challenges
- Create a class called instafollowerbot
- Create functions for login,find followers and follows
- Enables scroll down followers list
- Inside the follow() method find all the follow buttons in the modal (popup) and click on each of them in turn. Add a 1 second delay between each click, so you can seem more human
- Sometimes, you'll encounter an account that you have already followed, in this case, when you press on the button it will generate a popup asking if you want to unfollow that person
- When this happens the follow button is hidden under the popup and you will get a ElementClickInterceptedException  if you try to continue clicking on the follow button. Handle this exception and when it occurs, simply click on the "Cancel" button to dismiss the popup and continue to follow other people

#### Notes
- A very interesting project, i really took my time to digest the challenges and do them
