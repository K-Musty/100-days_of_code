# DAY 47 of 100 (Amazon Price Tracker)
----
- Scraping the Web with Beautiful Soup
- smtplib module
- requests module



### The challenge

- Step 1: Use BeautifulSoup to Scrape the Product Price
- Step 2: Email Alert When Price Below Preset Value

#### Notes
- This was part of the easiest days so far, the only issue was that i had to run it multiple times to get it to wotk, i think it is an anti bot problem, the next challenge was fairly easy, it was to send an email and it was a needed revision
